Notes:

*Why I chose MYSQL*
I chose MySQL as the database for this assignment because I encountered compatibility issues with setting up PostgreSQL on my Mac M1 system and 
installing the psycopg2 library. Due to these limitations, I opted for MySQL as an alternative database management system that is compatible with my 
system. MySQL is a popular and widely used open-source relational database management system known for its stability, performance, and ease of use. 
It has a large community of users and developers, which means that there are plenty of resources and documentation available for troubleshooting and 
support. MySQL also offers robust features for handling large datasets and complex queries, making it suitable for handling the simulated data from 
the online discussion community in this assignment. Overall, I chose MySQL as my database of choice for this assignment due to its compatibility with 
my system and its reputation as a reliable and efficient database management system.

* Discussion Question *
Discussion question is added as a file named Discussion Question

* Query solution *
Discussion question is added as a file named query_solution

* JSON File
I wrote the code in a way that would not consider the invalid JSON files. The function only takes the valid JSON from the files.

* What I wish I could have done more * 
I wish I could have proposed concrete idea on how different ways we can setup data pipelines for different formats like JSON and parquet.
